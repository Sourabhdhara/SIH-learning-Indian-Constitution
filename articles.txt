Union and State Relations
The Constitution of India establishes a federal system of government with clear division of powers between the Union (Central) Government and State Governments. This division is outlined in three lists:

**Three Lists:**
1. **Union List** - Subjects under exclusive jurisdiction of Central Government (97 subjects)
2. **State List** - Subjects under exclusive jurisdiction of State Governments (66 subjects)  
3. **Concurrent List** - Subjects under joint jurisdiction (47 subjects)

**Key Features:**
- **Single Constitution** for Union and States
- **Flexible Federalism** with unitary bias
- **Emergency Provisions** that can make the system unitary
- **Governor** as constitutional head of states

This system ensures both unity and diversity in governance.

Amendment Procedure
The Indian Constitution provides for its amendment under Article 368. The procedure varies depending on the nature of the amendment:

**Types of Amendments:**
1. **Simple Majority** - Some provisions can be amended by simple majority of Parliament
2. **Special Majority** - Most amendments require 2/3rd majority of members present and voting
3. **Ratification by States** - Some amendments also require ratification by half the state legislatures

**Key Points:**
- **Flexibility and Rigidity** - Constitution is neither too rigid nor too flexible
- **Judicial Review** - Supreme Court can review amendments (Basic Structure Doctrine)
- **104 Amendments** have been made so far (as of 2020)

The amendment procedure ensures the Constitution remains relevant while preserving its core principles.

Separation of Powers
The Indian Constitution incorporates the principle of separation of powers among three organs of government:

**Three Organs:**
1. **Legislature** - Parliament and State Legislatures (Law-making)
2. **Executive** - President, Prime Minister, Council of Ministers (Implementation)
3. **Judiciary** - Supreme Court, High Courts, Subordinate Courts (Interpretation)

**Features:**
- **Checks and Balances** - Each organ checks the others
- **Independence of Judiciary** - Judges have security of tenure
- **Parliamentary Supremacy** - Parliament is supreme in law-making
- **Executive Accountability** - Executive is accountable to Legislature

This ensures no single organ becomes too powerful and maintains democratic governance.
